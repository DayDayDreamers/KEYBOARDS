## Component Libraries

In order to keep Alamofire focused specifically on core networking implementations, additional component libraries have been created by the [Alamofire Software Foundation](https://github.com/Alamofire/Foundation) to bring additional functionality to the Alamofire ecosystem.

- [AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage) - An image library including image response serializers, `UIImage` and `UIImageView` extensions, custom image filters, an auto-purging in-memory cache and a priority-based image downloading system.
- [AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireNetworkActivityIndicator) - Controls the visibility of the network activity indicator on iOS using Alamofire. It contains configurable delay timers to help mitigate flicker and can support `URLSession` instances not managed by Alamofire.

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+ / macOS 10.10+ / tvOS 9.0+ / watchOS 2.0+
- Xcode 8.3+
- Swift 3.1+

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build Alamofire 4.0+.

To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '10.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.7'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate Alamofire into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Alamofire/Alamofire" ~> 4.7
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `Alamofire.framework` into your Xcode project.
